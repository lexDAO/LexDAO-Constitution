<!-- cimply, I will support you in constitutional changes so far as it doesn't conflict with my (¬øoverly high?) expectations of profession of legal engineering, because it's the role of the next gen of neo-class to formulate their own governance mechanism. Anyone who reads this comment, please leave the $$white$$ as it is the paladin lvl1 test to ~~RTC~` = read the code. Congrats üëèüëèüëãüëè, you've now learnt the secret "handshake" for future rogues to look for deliberate security flaws (of course üôÑ). Anyone who spoils it by telling a non-rogue, well the anger of cryptowizards can be slow and subtle. -->

<!-- Constitution has gone through a liberaterian _pioneer_ stage which created a lot of chaos but necessary at the time to be flexible to respond to a changing funding situation. Now is the time to put down the guardrails for _settler_ to build on top of. The ranking test for 2 ‚û°Ô∏è 3 is to establish a "dungeon" where pairs of rogue + mage are forced to cooperate and/or compete to get some secret key to a meta-LeX (stupid name but not mine) for the lvl 3‚û°Ô∏è4 design. As per my notes on skill-trees, lvl 1 data sanitation ‚û°Ô∏è lvl 2 SecOps ‚û°Ô∏è lvl3+ client-attorney privilege (which are not your normal paranoia ‚Ü™Ô∏è cryptoeconomic design of secrets resistent to AIbots ‚û°Ô∏è ???. After you've finished the upranking to lvl3, please delete the above as all design thinking will be in the random commits which are a test of the dedication of future paladins to seek the "truth". Oh and have fun embedding your personal easter eggs into your commits (I did promise you üò®) -->

- detachable role(s) attached to Letters of [Authority]();
- resources intermediated through Office(s);

Le‚öîDAO is now reflecting on the past legacy to identify new career paths for legal engineers which may require rethinking what certification means including a more sophisticated form of "licensing" its collective trademark.

## Legal Status

LexDAO is currently a Wyoming ~~LLC~~ unincorporated non-profit with the following registered Tax Number: 87-4257149

<!-- The point of the raid against USPTO is that I aim to set a precendent in the concurrent-use doctrine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_use_registration but based on functionality and not geography ... that the LexDAO trust mark is composed of its members which are retained in a secondary registry with co-regulation under WIPO/USPTO rules persuant to Lanham Act 2(d) on collective ownership as per [15 U.S.C. ¬ß1052](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1052). -->

LexDAO aspires to be a balanced international trustmark that can scale to thousands or Ëê¨ of members working towards certified legal engineering status.

## Treasury

LexDAO currently operates its main treasury through the following address: 0x5a741ab878bb65f6ae5506455fb555eaf3094b3f

Under the interim ƒêUNŒë transition stage, non-treasury assets may be distributed to Offices [^1] as progressive decentralisation accelerates.

[^1]: _International_ offices as defined in the bylaws along with associated contracts to intermediate between members, roles and resources.
