<!-- cimply, I will support you in constitutional changes so far as it doesn't conflict with my (¿overly high?) expectations of profession of legal engineering, because it's the role of the next gen of neo-class to formulate their own governance mechanism. Anyone who reads this comment, please leave the $$white$$ as it is the paladin lvl1 test to ~~RTC~` = read the code. Congrats 👏👏👋👏, you've now learnt the secret "handshake" for future rogues to look for deliberate security flaws (of course 🙄). Anyone who spoils it by telling a non-rogue, well the anger of cryptowizards can be slow and subtle. -->

<!-- Constitution has gone through a liberaterian _pioneer_ stage which created a lot of chaos but necessary at the time to be flexible to respond to a changing funding situation. Now is the time to put down the guardrails for _settler_ to build on top of. The ranking test for 2 ➡️ 3 is to establish a "dungeon" where pairs of rogue + mage are forced to cooperate and/or compete to get some secret key to a meta-LeX (stupid name but not mine) for the lvl 3➡️4 design. As per my notes on skill-trees, lvl 1 data sanitation ➡️ lvl 2 SecOps ➡️ lvl3+ client-attorney privilege (which are not your normal paranoia ↪️ cryptoeconomic design of secrets resistent to AIbots ➡️ ???. After you've finished the upranking to lvl3, please delete the above as all design thinking will be in the random commits which are a test of the dedication of future paladins to seek the "truth". Oh and have fun embedding your personal easter eggs into your commits (I did promise you 😨) -->

## License

The LexDAO Consitution is presented under a Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International license.

Le⚔DAO is now reflecting on the past legacy to identify new career paths for legal engineers which may require rethinking what certification means including a more sophisticated form of "licensing" its collective trademark.


## Legal Status

LexDAO is currently a Wyoming unincorporated non-profit with the following registered Tax Number: 87-4257149

<!-- The point of the raid against USPTO is that I aim to set a precendent in the concurrent-use doctrine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_use_registration but based on functionality and not geography ... that the LexDAO trust mark is composed of its members which are retained in a secondary registry with co-regulation under WIPO/USPTO rules persuant to Lanham Act 2(d) on collective ownership as per [15 U.S.C. §1052](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1052). -->

LexDAO aspires to be a balanced international trustmark that can scale to thousands or 萬 of members working towards certified legal engineering status.




## Treasury

LexDAO currently operates its main treasury through the following address: 0x5a741ab878bb65f6ae5506455fb555eaf3094b3f

Under the interim ĐUNΑ transition stage, non-treasury assets may be distributed to Offices [^1] as progressive decentralisation accelerates.

[^1]: _International_ offices as defined in the bylaws along with associated contracts to intermediate between members, roles and resources.
