## Comments
<!--LexDAO aspires to be a balanced international trustmark that can scale to thousands or 萬 of members working towards certified legal engineering status.-->

<!-- The point of the raid against USPTO is that I aim to set a precendent in the concurrent-use doctrine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_use_registration but based on functionality and not geography ... that the LexDAO trust mark is composed of its members which are retained in a secondary registry with co-regulation under WIPO/USPTO rules persuant to Lanham Act 2(d) on collective ownership as per [15 U.S.C. §1052](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1052). -->

<!-- Revision in light of [Meta-LeX](https://metalex.substack.com/p/the-metalex-whitepaper) and provisional upgrade to WY ĐUNΑ.
- detachable role(s) attached to Letters of [Authority]();
- resources intermediated through Office(s);
- automation to augment the principled member(s).-->
