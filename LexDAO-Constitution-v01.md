# Constitution of LexDAO Club 

### Originally Adopted July 24, 2020

# Article I - Organization

**Section 1.1 - Status.**  LexDAO is an unincorporated nonprofit association under Wyo. Stat. Title 17, Ch. 22 of the laws of the State of Wyoming.

LexDAO is not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, a partnership.

**Section 1.2 - Purposes.** As more fully stated in its Mission Statement (as may be updated from time to time via governance) LexDAO is organized to form a club of legal engineering professionals, united to innovate and bring the traditional legal settlement layer to code, and coded agreements to the masses. We believe that everyone deserves access to justice provided in a quick and efficient manner. If legal services were easier to use, verify, and enforce, we could live in a fairer world. Distributed ledger technology offers solutions to many problems in the legal space. Our mission is to research, develop and evangelize first-class legal methods and blockchain protocols that secure rules and promises with code rather than trust. We do this by training LexDAO-certified legal engineers and building LexDAO-certified blockchain applications. We strive to balance new deterministic tools with the equitable considerations of law to better serve citizens on a cooperative and nonprofit basis for the primary and mutual benefit of its members and common good.

**Section 1.3 - Not a Law Firm and Not Your Lawyer.** LexDAO is not a law firm and cannot give legal advice.

LexDAO members, or users of any LexDAO resources, should contact their attorney to obtain advice with respect to any particular legal matter. No reader, user, or browser of LexDAO websites or services should act or refrain from acting on the basis of information on this site without first seeking legal advice from counsel in the relevant jurisdiction. Only your individual personal attorney can provide assurances that the information contained herein – and your interpretation of it – is applicable or appropriate to your particular situation.
